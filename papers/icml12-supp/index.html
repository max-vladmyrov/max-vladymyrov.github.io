	<li><p> <a href="ee_COIL_multiple_runs.gif">ee_COIL_multiple_runs.gif</a>: GIF animation of 50 runs of the EE algorithm
	  with 10 manifolds from the COIL-20 data set (N=720) initialized randomly
	  close to 0. The affinities are constructed with a perplexity of 20. The
	  animation shows the decrease of the objective function vs the number of
	  iterations with time. Our preferred method (SD) is able to decrease
	  the objective function to the lowest value among all methods. In
	  addition, the method is able to take far more iterations than methods
	  that have to solve a linear system (SD-).</p></li>

	<li><p><a href="ee_homotopy.gif">ee_homotopy.gif</a>: GIF animation of the homotopy optimization for the EE
	  method with 10 manifolds from the COIL-20 data set (N=720). Most of the
	  methods converge to the same embedding. However, the runtime required to
	  achieve that result is dramatically different depending on each method. 
	  Again, SD works very well.</p></li>

	<li><p><a href="ee_MNIST.gif">ee_MNIST.gif</a>: GIF animation of the EE run on the subset of MNIST data set
	  with N=20000 random images of digits from 0 to 9. The runtime is limited 
	  to 60 minutes for all the methods. The spectral direction (SD) is the only 
	  method that is able to produce a reasonable embedding that separates most 
	  of the digits already after 15 minutes of runtime.</p></li>
